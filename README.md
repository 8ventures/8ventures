### Hello World, I'm Luis Carrasco 👋

🚀 Fusing Finance, Tech & Impact Investing on a Mission to Innovate

🌍 Born under the warm Spanish sun 🇪🇸, but now finding a second home amid the scenic beauty of Geneva, Switzerland 🇨🇭.

💼 With the titles of Portfolio Manager and Software Engineer under my belt, I've dedicated myself to building bridges between the financial and tech universes. My endgame? Game-changing solutions enriched with quantitative insights, financial acumen, and technological prowess.

💻 With TypeScript, React, Next.js, and backend sorcery like Node, Express, Mongo, and Postgres at my disposal, I engineer robust, purpose-driven applications. These digital solutions are tailor-made to integrate seamlessly with financial strategies and goals.

💰 Whether it's navigating the diverse world of assets like cryptocurrencies and structured products or advocating for impact investing, I believe in making each dollar count. I've founded the APES Council, a pioneering crypto investment club with a firm focus on Ethereum-based yield strategies.

📈 Leveraging the power of data, I've honed a formidable track record in optimizing portfolio performance, sculpting bespoke financial solutions, and delivering sustainable investment outcomes.

🌊 Currently learning how to sail, exploring a new horizon beyond tech and finance.
