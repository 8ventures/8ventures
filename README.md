### Hello World, I'm Luis Carrasco 👋

🚀 Fusing Finance, Tech & Impact Investing on a Mission to Innovate

🌍 🇪🇸 Spanish at heart, but now calling the heart of Europe - Geneva, Switzerland 🇨🇭, my home.

💼 Donning the hats of a Portfolio Manager, CFA, and Software Engineer, I'm passionate about building bridges between finance and technology. My endgame? To architect game-changing solutions steeped in quantitative insights, financial wisdom, and technological prowess.

💻 With TypeScript, React, Next.js, and backend sorcery like Node, Express, Mongo, and Postgres at my disposal, I engineer robust, purpose-driven applications. These digital solutions are tailor-made to integrate seamlessly with financial strategies and goals.

💰 Whether it's navigating the diverse world of assets like cryptocurrencies and structured products or advocating for impact investing, I believe in making each dollar count. I've founded the APES Council, a pioneering crypto investment club with a firm focus on Ethereum-based yield strategies.

📈 Leveraging the power of data, I've honed a formidable track record in optimizing portfolio performance, sculpting bespoke financial solutions, and delivering sustainable investment outcomes.
